## This branch contains a modified version of Klipper used for testing in a ROS2 simulated environment
## The only change to the host is the change from serial to ROS based communication, other functionality related changes should be merged from the main feature branch (SMF)
## The clinet software has been rewritten as a ROS node to be able to control the joint states in the simulation, while reusing as much code as possible from the original firmware.
